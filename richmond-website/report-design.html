    <p>
      In this section the design process of this website and of the graphical interface (GUI) used for the experiments is going to be explained in detail.
    </p>

    <h5 class="w3-padding-32"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">2.1 Website </span></h5>
    <p>
      The whole website is based in <span class="mh-text-itallic">Cafe</span>, one of the several templates provided in open access by W3-Schools. This template was already designed to be responsive, that is, it resizes the contents to make it look good in a wide set of devices. Too small screens make difficult to see the images and read the text clearly, so the minimum width of the window has been set to 700 pixels. This means that, if the window is smaller than 700px, the contents are still accessible, but the user would need to use the horizontal scroll to be able to see them.
    </p>

    <p>
      Images are horizontally centred and have the option <span class="mh-text-itallic">alt</span> configured, so alternative information is provided if a user, for some reason, cannot view it (e.g. slow connection, error in <span class="mh-text-itallic">src</span> attribute, user using a screen reader). Anyway, a caption has been also included below each image, explaining what is the image about.
    </p>

    <p>
      One of the requirements of the website was that it was possible to download the files related to the assignment from it. In order to do that, three links were included in the Home page and again in the top navigation bar, so they will be accessible anywhere on the website. The possibility of downloading the report in PDF has been added in case, despite the measures taken, some of the contents cannot be well visualised.
    </p>

    <p>
      All pages of this website follow the same pattern:
    </p>

    <ul class="mh-real-list">
      <li>
        <span class="mh-text-bold">Navigation Bar</span>. It is fixed to the top of the page and allows the navigation across the website. The "Report" and "Download" menus are expanded when the user leaves the cursor on the correspondent button, changing the background of the option selected to light grey. The bar stays at the top of the page, losing its "fixed" feature, when the window's width is smaller than 700px, so the horizontal scrolling can be enabled.
      </li>

      <li>
        <span class="mh-text-bold">Header</span>. It contains the name of the student on the left, the name of the assignment in the center and the student's ID on the right. Depending of the width and height of the window, a different part of the image will be shown, filling always the width of the window.
      </li>
      
      <li>
        <span class="mh-text-bold">Text Body</span>. The text is centred horizontally and the alignment is set as justified. 
      </li>
      
      <li>
        <span class="mh-text-bold">Footer</span>. It allows the user to go back to the top of the page by clicking on the button "To the top". Besides, it contains icons that links to the personal Twitter and LinkedIn accounts of the student and the Github repository used for the assignment. When the cursor is on it, the background is changed to black.
      </li>
    </ul>

    The report could have been included as one big page, but in order to allow the reader to quickly select what to read and improve the usability in general, it has been divided in different pages.

    <ol start="0" class="mh-real-list">
      <li>
        <span class="mh-text-bold"> Home</span>. Here we find the background of the author, the explanation of the original experiment of Watanabe et al. and a brief description of the approach followed in this assignment. Here we also find the links, placed into icons, to download the different files of the assignment. When we place the cursor on one of this icons, it becomes bigger, its colour becomes more saturated and the text below is underlined. The user needs to have Javascript activated in the browser for the latter, but the rest of features would work as usual.
      </li>
      
      <li>
        <span class="mh-text-bold">Description</span>. Full description of the approach followed for the experiments. The two sounds used are located inside <span class="mh-text-itallic">audio</span> tags. They try to load the sound from the first source, which is the sound file. If the browser does not support HTML audio tags, they will load the message instead, reporting the situation to the user.
      </li>
      <img id="audio-tags" class="mh-image" src="imgs/audio-tags.png" alt="Code of the audio in the Description">
        <span class="mh-caption w3-medium">Code used to include the audio in the Description</span>
      </img>
      
      <li>
        <span class="mh-text-bold">Design</span>. Current website where the design of the website and the GUI is explained.
      </li>
      
      <li>
        <span class="mh-text-bold">Evaluation</span>. pass
      </li>
      
      <li>
        <span class="mh-text-bold">Summary</span>. pass
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h5 class="w3-padding-32"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">2.2 Graphical User Interface </span></h5>
    <p>
      The design of the GUI started analysing the controls that would be necessary to add in order to perform the altered experiment. These controls are, first, being able to select one (and only one) of the sounds; and second, being able to select the latency of the sound among three possible values: 200ms before the collision, at the moment of the collision or 200ms after. Some other controls were added besides these two:
    </p>

    <ul class="mh-real-list">
      <li><span class="mh-text-bold">Play/Pause</span>. Stops the animation of the dots, so it is easier to explain how the GUI works to the observers.</li>

      <li><span class="mh-text-bold">Result Input</span>. Allow the observers to use the mouse instead of the keyboard (keys &larr; and &rarr;) to report their perception.</li>
      
      <li><span class="mh-text-bold">Sound on/off</span>. Same as the Play/Pause control, make it easier the explanation without the collision sound in the background.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Once we know what the GUI should include, the next step is to create a mockup. The image below shows the mockup used in the design process of our GUI, created using the online tool Balsamiq Cloud.
    </p>

    <img id="mockup-gui" class="mh-image" src="imgs/mockup.png" alt="Mockup of the GUI">
      <span class="mh-caption w3-medium">Mockup of the GUI</span>
    </img>

    <p>
      The Play/Pause button is placed in the centre, taking the usual structure of a music or video player. The Result Input buttons, located on the sides, have attached a label that indicates their function. The latency is controlled with a slider, located just below these buttons. It will have a total of three values, being the latency zero (i.e. sound when dots collide) the default.  
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The sound used in the experiment is set using radio buttons, which means that when one of them is selected, the other one is automatically unselected. As we did with the Result Input buttons, they also have attached a label indicating the sound enabled by each one. Finally, the Sound on/off button is located on the east top corner of the window.
    </p>

    <p>
      Using the given code and with the help of the mockup, we can finally start developing the GUI. The language used in the implementation is Processing, an open-source programming language built on Java that uses a simplified syntax. The library ControlP5, written by Andreas Schlegel, provide a wide set of controls that we have used to build our GUI. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The library provide the functionality of the controls, but the deafault layout is very basic. In order to create different buttons, we load an image (all downloaded from <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/">Flaticon</a>) in the moment we create them.
